# Friendly Wager Facebook Chatbot

## What is this? 

This was made for the 2018 Facebook Sports Hackathon, where it won Second Place Overall! It was fully concieved, designed, and presented within 6 hours. It uses FB's Messenger API (and a lot of its tutorial code still lingers as we ran out of time during the hackathon). It currently serves as a proof of concept for an idea that our team is slowly building upon and growing!
